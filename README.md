# Air Failure Detector

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and modeling air pressure system failures in Scania trucks using the dataset [Air Pressure System Failures in Scania Trucks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/aps-failure-at-scania-trucks-data-set) from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

This notebook aims to detect air pressure system failures in Scania trucks by applying machine learning techniques. The notebook is structured into several key sections:

## Notebook Structure

- **EDA:** Exploratory Data Analysis. This section includes initial data exploration, visualization, and understanding of the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes scripts and functions for cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Model Training:** Covers the training of machine learning models using the preprocessed data.
- **Post-Processing:** Contains results and visualizations related to the analysis and predictions made by the model.
- **Model Validation:** Includes evaluation metrics and validation results to assess the performance of the trained model.
